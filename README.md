# bibliography
BibTeX master file and rules. Please make sure that the contents of `math.bib` are identical to the output of the command `bibtool -r rules.rsc -i math.bib`.

Easier way: run ./prettybib <bib-file> to convert <bib-file> to the nice format specified by rules. This will overwrite <bib-file>.
